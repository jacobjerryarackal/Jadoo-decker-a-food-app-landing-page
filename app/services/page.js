            Welcome to Jadoo Decker, where we’ve been serving mouth-watering burgers for over 60 years! 
          Since our humble beginnings in 1964, we've become a beloved staple in the community, known for our commitment
          to great service, taste, quality, and quantity. Founded by the Jacob family, Jadoo Decker began as a small
          roadside stand with a simple mission: to create the best burgers in town. Over the decades, we’ve grown and evolved,
          but our core values remain unchanged.</p>
